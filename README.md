Multi-Frame-Point-Correspondence
================================

Multi-frame point correspondence algorithm implementation, A project from the Intelligent systems department of computer science. The mission: Given a set of K snapshots of N similar moving objects measured by a sensor/camera, our goal was to identify each object's path without having any information that distinguishes between each two objects, the algorithm is based on representing the problem as a graph, and using some reductions of graph theory. The output: a set of paths representing the correspondences between each two points on every object's movement path. Implemented in C++. Environment: Visual Studio.
